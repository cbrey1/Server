This is the README file for the Server Project.

To start the Server, right click the ServerDriver class and select Run As -> Java Application.

This is all that is needed for this project. There is no GUI for the Server. To stop the Server, select the Terminate button in the Console within your Java IDE.

Now that the Server is running, download the Client project. Within the Client project, run the ClientGUI to chat with other Clients through the Server!
